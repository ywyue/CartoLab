## Introduction

![Teaser Image](https://github.com/ywyue/CartoLab/blob/main/teaser.PNG)

The project aims to give users an overview of the global economy and trade trends under the COVID-19 pandemic by web-based visualization methods. Through the interactive visualization of economic and trading-related data, users may understand how the global trade and economy is affected from the pre-COVID period to now.

The realization of the project is a web-based story map, with multimedia, interactive charts and maps. We set the project at global scale, but the trade trend and trading-related policies in China is the case study in the story map.

We assume the target groups as citizens who can get knowledge of how the world trade was impacted by COVID-19. The product could tell a simple but clear story about the world economy and trading during the pandemic. Please refer more details in the [technical report](https://github.com/ywyue/CartoLab/blob/main/CartoLab_Report.pdf).
